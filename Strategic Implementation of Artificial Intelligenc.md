## Introduction

The energy sector faces unprecedented workforce challenges, with a projected global skills gap of 1.5 million workers by 2030 and 32% of current oil and gas workers reaching retirement age within this decade (IEA, 2023). Traditional HR approaches have proven insufficient in addressing these challenges, creating an urgent need for innovative solutions. Artificial intelligence presents a transformative opportunity to revolutionize human resource management across the talent lifecycle, with particular potential in talent acquisition.

This report examines how AI technologies can be strategically deployed to address critical HR challenges in the energy sector. We analyze various use cases, select the most promising application, and develop a comprehensive implementation framework. Additionally, we assess risks, compliance requirements, and change management considerations to ensure successful deployment.
